# English Language Learning Test Site

## Description
This is a simple educational website built with HTML and CSS to help users practice English vocabulary through interactive quizzes. The site features tests involving images, videos, and audio to identify common words (e.g., animals, objects, and sounds). It also includes basic login and registration forms for user accounts, making it a test project for web development basics.

## Features
- **Header**: Site title and introductory description.
- **Quizzes Section**:
  - Test 1: Identify "cat" from an image (with radio buttons for options like lion, dog, cat, wolf).
  - Test 2: Identify "car" from a video clip (options: bicycle, car, sun, tree).
  - Test 3: Identify "music" from an audio file (options: music, fat, flower, snak).
- **Buttons**: Review, retest, and remove buttons with hover effects.
- **Login Form**: Fields for username, password, and email.
- **Registration Form**: Fields for username, name, family, birthday (date picker), gender (select dropdown), email, password, repeat password, and optional description (textarea).
- **Footer**: Support links (e.g., to Dreamstime), developer email, and an embedded GIF.
- Interactive elements like hover effects on quiz options (enlarges text and adds background/border) and button hovers.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: For structure, forms, media elements (img, video, audio), and semantic tags (header, section, article, footer).
- CSS: Meyer reset for consistent styling, custom rules for layout (borders, padding, fonts), colors (e.g., orange, burlywood, khaki), and interactions (hover effects on lists and buttons).
- Media handling: Supports images (with favicon), video (with poster and controls), and audio (with preload and controls).
